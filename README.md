## About 🤔💭
CarpPool is an application designed to assist and streamline the process of organizing carpool groups. It simiplifies determing who's driving who and when are where pick ups take place for car pool arrangements.

The organization process is simplifed. To start, all the leader has to do is create an event and share the event code. Anyone with the event code can join the even, voulunteer to help drive, or join a car pool group, all without having to worry about making an account.

The trip dashboard displays all the information about car pool arrangements for the event. It also allows for easy modification, so arrangements can be changed if someone comes up.
